<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Aditya Gosavi, a motivated professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, algorithms, and problem-solving.
  My technical expertise includes implementing innovative solutions like the Two-Branch Kruskal Algorithm, which has demonstrated
  superior performance over traditional methods. With a passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I bring
  creativity and analytical skills to every project I undertake.</p>

<p>Currently, I am developing a digital stethoscope that integrates hardware components like microphones, sound sensors, and 
  Bluetooth modules with an Arduino Uno. This project exemplifies my ability to work with electronics and embedded systems to create 
  impactful innovations. I thrive on designing and executing projects that merge technical knowledge with practical application.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I am an avid motorcyclist and enjoy exploring new horizons on my Dominar 400. My hobbies
  reflect my dynamic personality and ability to balance work with personal growth. Whether itâ€™s on the road or at my desk, I am always 
  eager to push boundaries, learn, and contribute meaningfully to projects and teams.</p>
